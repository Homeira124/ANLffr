ANLffr
==========

From the `Systems Neuroscience of Auditory Perception lab at Purdue University <https://engineering.purdue.edu/SNAPLab>`_,
a set of tools to analyze and interpret auditory steady-state responses, 
particularly the subcortical kind commonly known as frequency-following responses (FFRs). 
In particular, the package provides code for multitaper-analysis of spectra and phase locking 
along with complex-principal component analysis of phase-locking for multichannel FFRs. 
Support for "bootstrapping" any of the included functions is also available via the ``boostrap`` module.
Finally, time-frequency analysis can also be performed flexibly using the ``tfr`` module.
Although originally created to analyze steady-state electrophysiological responses,
the generality of the spectral analysis and time-frequency analysis function allow them to be applied widely.
Typical usage would begin with::
    
    #!/usr/bin/env python

    from anlffr import spectral

    # If using a Biosemi EEG system
    from anlffr.helper import biosemi2mne

Get the latest code
-------------------

To get the latest code using git, simply type::

    git clone https://github.com/SNAPsoftware/ANLffr.git

To use the pre-release version v0.1.0, type::

    git checkout tags/v0.1.0

If you don't have git installed, you can download a zip or tarball
of the latest code: https://github.com/SNAPsoftware/ANLffr/archive/master.zip
If you have pip, you may be able to download and install anlffr in one step using (and hence skip the "Install anlffr" steps below)::

    pip install git+https://github.com/SNAPsoftware/ANLffr.git --user

   *Note*: The GITHUB URL for this package has changed. The old URLs will continue to be redirected here. However, if you have local copies of the repository with the old URL, please update your remote bindings within git for easier longterm maintenance::

        git remote set-url origin https://github.com/SNAPsoftware/ANLffr.git

Install anlffr
--------------

As with any Python packages, to install ANLffr, go into the ANLffr source
code directory and do::

    python setup.py install

or if you don't have admin access to your python setup (permission denied
when install) use::

    python setup.py install --user


Dependencies
------------

Packages NumPy >= 1.4, SciPy >= 0.7.2 are required for the code in the spectral.py module to work. `MNE-python <http://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python>`_ >= 0.7 is required for the modules in the anlffr.helper package (For importing Biosemi BDF files and preprocessing).

Getting Started
---------------
The `examples directory <https://github.com/SNAPsoftware/ANLffr/tree/master/examples>`_ 
contains a sample script that you could modify for your purposes. 
That would be a good place to get started! 
See `Bharadwaj & Shinn-Cunningham (2014) <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1388245714000443>`_
for details of the multichannel complex-PCA method. 
For details of the PLV computation and bootstrapping, 
see `Zhu et al. (2013) <http://www.cns.bu.edu/~shinn/resources/pdfs/2013/2013JASA_Zhu.pdf>`_.

Briefly, consider the following example::

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    # If you already have a data.mat file with data

    # Using scipy to load the data
    from scipy import io
    dat = io.loadmat(path_to_data + 'data.mat')

    # Say the variable containing the data array is 'x'
    x = dat['x']

    # View to check if 'x' is in the right format
    x.shape

    # Import the spectral module to calculate PLV
    from anlffr import spectral

    # Set parameters for the PLV computation
    # Sampling rate is 4096 Hz
    # Frequencies of interest are with 5 and 500 Hz
    # Calculate inter-trial coherence instead of PLV
    # Zero-pad data to the next power of 2 for fast FFT
    # Use 3 tapers with the time-half bandwidth product of 2
    params = dict(Fs = 4096, tapers = [2, 3], fpass = [5, 500], itc = 1,
                  pad = 1)

    # Actually compute the phase-locking measure (ITC here)
    (plv, f) = spectral.mtplv(x, params)

    # Plot results for channel number 31 (index 30)
    # Use pylab for plotting

    import pylab as pl
    pl.plot(f, plv[30,:],linewidth = 2)
    pl.xlabel('Frequency (Hz)', fontsize = 20)
    pl.ylabel('Inter-Trial Coherence')
    pl.show()
